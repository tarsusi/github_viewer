# Github Viewer

This application is written in React Native. Shows github repositories, pull requests and issues for selected repository.

## Project initialization

After cloning the project run below command:

```javascript
yarn install // or npm install
```

Not: If you targeted the iOS environment you should also need to install pods. It can be done directly in `ios` folder and run the command:

```javascript
pod install
```

Or you can just use the script, named **podsinstall**, described in `package.json`

```javascript
yarn run podsinstall // or npm run podsinstall
```
